Task 1
This Streamlit app collects user information through a form, including name, age, address, email, and a 4-digit PIN. It validates the email format using a regular expression and ensures the PIN is exactly four digits. Upon successful validation, it displays the submitted data with the PIN masked for privacy.

Task 2
This Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for uploading, previewing, filtering, and downloading CSV files. Users can upload a CSV file via the sidebar, view a preview or the full dataset, and apply filters based on selected column values. The app dynamically displays the filtered results and includes an option to download the filtered data as a new CSV file. It also includes error handling for invalid or empty files, ensuring smooth user experience. Potential improvements include support for multiple filters, dynamic filter types based on data (e.g., sliders for numbers), visualizations, and pagination for large datasets.

Task 3
This Streamlit app serves as an interactive educational tool on Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data Management (EDM). It provides topic-based content in a sidebar menu, using expanders, tabs, charts, and visualizations to explain key concepts like ETL, data integration, and governance. It also includes an interactive quiz to reinforce learning and improve user engagement.

Task 4
This Streamlit app is a dynamic COVID-19 data dashboard that fetches and visualizes real-time data from an external API based on the user's selected country. It displays daily and cumulative statistics using various charts (line, pie, bar, and area) and includes interactive features like a raw data table toggle and a CSV download option. The app helps users explore the progression of cases, deaths, and recoveries over the last 30 days in an intuitive and visually rich format.

Task 5
This Streamlit app functions as a simple School Management Dashboard connected to a MySQL database, allowing authenticated users to view and manage data from menu and orders tables. It includes login validation, dynamic SQL table viewing with optional filters, and form-based record insertion. By combining data access with a user-friendly UI, it enables basic CRUD operations in an educational or cafeteria-related database.

Task 6
This Streamlit app enables real-time webcam streaming with visual filter controls and a snapshot feature. Users can adjust brightness and contrast, apply filters like grayscale, Canny edge detection, Gaussian blur, and sepia, and capture snapshots that are saved with timestamps. The app leverages OpenCV for video processing and integrates interactive controls through Streamlit's UI, making it ideal for simple webcam-based image processing demos.
